# kitchenconverter
This is my very first software project. Based in Germany, I work as a Business Analyst in an IT Consultancy for insurance companies, where I function as an interface between 
the client's business requirements and the software engineers. I'm mostly occupied with test executions.
Through my day-to-day job, I have become curious about software development itself and decided to learn some fundamentals about web development (JavaScript, HTML, CSS). 
I'm also interested in designing User Interfaces and the entire agile development process. 
KitchenConverter is supposed to be a simple, leightweight tool to convert the amount of typical baking ingredients from cups and spoons to metric values and vice-versa. The focus
lays on usability. The "highlight" is the slider to set the amount of cups / spoons. I took lots of inspiration from codepen.io and adjusted it to my needs. 

KitchenConverter is not intended to be a highly successful commercial website. However, I intend to set it "live" with a real domain sooner or later.
